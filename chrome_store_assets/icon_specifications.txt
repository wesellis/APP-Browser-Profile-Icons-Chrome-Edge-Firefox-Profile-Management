
ICON CREATION GUIDE
==================

Create these icon files in chrome-extension/images/:

1. icon16.png (16x16)
2. icon48.png (48x48)
3. icon128.png (128x128)

Design suggestions:
- Use a grid of 4 colored squares/circles
- Each square represents a profile
- Use vibrant colors: blue, green, orange, purple
- Add subtle shadow for depth
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

Store Icon (128x128):
- Same design but with more polish
- Add subtle gradient
- Ensure it stands out in the Chrome Web Store
